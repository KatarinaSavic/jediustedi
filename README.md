## Project Overview

Jedi&Uštedi is a simple MERN app for showcasing my work as a Full-stack web developer. It helps in a mission to fight food waste, by connecting businesses that have food surpluses with local customers that want to buy it. A business partner can perform CRUD operations on its own offers, while customers can search, and reserve active offers. Also, the logged customer receives personalized offers, based on location, kitchen type, and frequently ordered dishes.
